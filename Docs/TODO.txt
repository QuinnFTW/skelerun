To do:

1. Timer system that:
	E. Begins with a fair but challenging amount of time based on playtests (+ balanced with time pickups)

2. Score system that: 
	C. Is balaced properly 
		NOTE: Score increases when completing a room and picking up a gem,
			decreases when hit and constantly ticks down. We need to balance these values

3. Add pickups to most/every level




Optional:

1. Create extra decorations to spice up existing levels
